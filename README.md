# Project 2 (Julien Lamalle)

### This project was done in python <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="python" width="30" height="30"/>

This project enables an association of chess players to manage the tournaments they organise.

To clone this folder, execute the following command: 

```
git clone git@github.com:JulienLamalle/OC-DA-PYTHON_P4.git
```

From your terminal you can enter the file as follows: 

```
cd OC-DA-PYTHON_P4
```

To avoid conflicts with potential existing projects I strongly recommend that you create a virtual environment for this project using this command:

```
python -m venv env
```

Then you have to activate your environment:

```
source env/bin/activate
```

You now need to install all the libraries necessary for this program to work properly, for this you can run the following command: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You are now with your console in the program folder so you can launch it like this: 

```
python main.py
```

Now you can create a player in your database, create a tournament and register players, take over an existing tournament, display the list of players or display the list of tournaments

### ENJOY ðŸŽ‰ !
